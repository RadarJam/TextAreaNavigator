# The project
This project is started to understand the basics of `Vue.js`. The goal is to create a form which content could be traversed with the `tab` key, this feature is used  to easily manipulate keypoints (marked with `{{` and `}}` in the form) to quickly fill out said form. For handheld devices, such as smartphones, it should be possible to press buttons to traverse the form.

## Installation 
`npm install`

## Testing
To test the project use `npm test`and `npm run cover` for code coverage.
